## Installation

Note: THIS IS VERY VERY COMPLICATED. Sorry, in the next two months
I hope to have an account system where the only thing you'll need
to do is install HomeStar. 

### Install NodeJS

This is heavily dependent on NodeJS.

### Install HomeStar

    $ npm install -g homestar   ## may require sudo
    $ homestar setup

If you have a WeMo

    $ homestar install homestar-wemo

If you have a Hue

    $ homestar install homestar-hue
    $ homestar configure homestar-hue

If you have a LIFX

    $ homestar install homestar-lifx

If you have an ITach IR controller

    $ homestar install homestar-itach-ir

### Make Certs

### Alexa Skill: alexa

### AWS Lambda: HomeStar
